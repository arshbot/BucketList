# BucketList

A bucket list of every project I want to build at some point in my life. I was wondering why I didn't really have a bucket list like most people when I realized that I DO have a bucket list. Just not in the same way as most people. My bucket list is filled with projects I want to tackle one day


* **Minecraft in Rust** -- Take a week and shotgun a project where I not only learn Rust, but take a crack at game development
* **Venmo for Crypto** -- Simple idea, shouldn't be too difficult. As always with wallet's the most difficult part will be notifying users when they get more money from the network
* **Minecraft on the Blockchain** -- A blockchain protocol backed by what I'll call "Proof of Play". In order to mine a block of transaction, players have to traverse a randomly generated minecraft obstacle course. Once the first player completes it, the game resets for everyone so they can begin playing on the next block (which generates an entirely different course). The difficulty could change so the blocks are mined at a constant rate, meaning the obstacle course is difficult enough to stop players from speed beating it, but not difficult enough to prevent players from ever beating it. Hopefully they will be able to beat it within 5 or 10 minutes. Total moonshot idea I'll have to sink time into when I need a side project down and #1 on this list is already crossed off.
* **Postman for Websockets** -- A nice GUI for those protocols not many people use, but the people that do use them use them extensively. JSON-RPC would fall into this category as well.
